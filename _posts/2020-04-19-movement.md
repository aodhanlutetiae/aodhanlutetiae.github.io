Google, Apple and Citymapper have each released data they collect from our mapping or location apps. The data shows that the public started to stay home well before national lockdowns were ordered. 

Google's data shows the change in Londoner's movement across six categories, and the trends reflect what you'd expect. Three categories -- work, non-essential retail and transport stations -- basically collapse, compared to a few months earlier. Two others drop but not completely: parks and essential retail like grocery stores. And, also unsurprisingly, movement classed as 'residential' increases.

All these trends began well before the government ordered a national shutdown on March 20th; Londoners began to do all these things from March 9th onwards. A rush on grocery stores is also visible as the numbers climb all the way to the 20th. 

This could read as a measure of hesitation by the UK government - this weekend the UK press is full of recriminations over the handling of the Coronavirus pandemic. The Sunday Times headlines [38 days when Britain sleepwalked into disaster](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh) and one of the Guardian's most-read pieces is [How did Britain get its Coronvirus response so wrong?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong).

The data from Apple shows the same trend, that people stopped in the UK walking - or at least stopped using the 'Walking' feature in the mapping app, well before the shutdown. The trend is exaggerated in London with the numbers sinking almost to 20% of what they were, while the rest of the UK hovers around 40% of what it was.

This tendency of movement slowing before shutdown is not unique to London however. 

Citymapper data shows that in cities like Berlin or Paris, the data shows a dropoff well before governments ordered people to stay home. Although the length of time between movement slowing and the ordering of a shutdown is probably longer in the UK, at more than ten days.
