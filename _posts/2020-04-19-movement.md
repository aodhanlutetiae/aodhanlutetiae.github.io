This weekend the UK press is full of recriminations over the handling of the Coronavirus pandemic. Data from mobile phone apps show people were staying home well before the government shut down the country for good. The country was behind, compared to the rest of Europe and usage data from Google, Apple and Citymapper show that people in London stopped moving about before they were told to.
