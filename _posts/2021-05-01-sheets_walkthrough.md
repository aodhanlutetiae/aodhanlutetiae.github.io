How to get a CSV (comma separated values) file into a spreadsheet using Google Sheets and get working with it.

---

Download the following file to your computer: [bags_2years.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15vDqg-u6W4tHouC42uvhMOdy21oTl3ov/view?usp=sharing)

Once the file is on your computer, right-click on it and under **Open With** choose **Text Edit (Mac)** or **WHAT(Windows)** to look at what's actually in the file. All the values are separated by commas:

> Year, Company name, Number of single use plastic bags issued, Gross proceeds of charge (Â£)

> 2018-19, A F Blakemore & Son Ltd,"5,114,183","255,709.15"

> 2018-19, Age UK Trading CIC,"563,644","28,182.20"

In your own Google Drive, open a new Sheet by clicking **+ New**, then **Google Sheets**, then **Blank Spreadsheet**

In the new Sheet, click on the name **Untitled Spreadsheet** on the top left and give your Sheet a name

Under File select **Import**, then **Upload**

Choose your **bags_2years.csv** file from your computer

If asked in a dialogue box about **Import Location**, select **Insert New Sheet** and for **Separator Type**, choose **Comma** or **Detect Automatically**

You should now have the CSV file in your Sheet:
