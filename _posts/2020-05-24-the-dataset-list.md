The 'bin' into which I regularly pop interesting online datasets has been overflowing. So I've sat down and sorted it out and popped it online.

The dataset list is cleaned up and is up [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jwWhnAXX1ctCH7C4Q3De6Za8PV5Xo61gCfeMVOeIUTg/edit?usp=sharing) version

So what can you find in it?



-----------
I have a spider that tests all the links so, for now at least, they're all working.
