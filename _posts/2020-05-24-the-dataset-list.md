The 'bin' into which I regularly pop interesting online datasets has been overflowing. So I've sat down and sorted it out and popped it online via joedocs.

The dataset list is cleaned up and is up <a href="https://joedocs.com/aodhanlutetiae/109e5080-ef40-43ee-9530-da3a775a74df" target="_blank">here</a>

So what can you find in it?

I have a spider that tests all the links so, for now at least, they're all working.
