A few months ago I looked at levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in Cardiff - in the pedestrianised citycentre and on the busy Newport Road. NO2 is a major contributor to air pollution and is generally caused by traffic. Now it's time to see what' been happening during the lockdown in the Welsh village of Hafodyrynys, famous for having some of the dirtiest air in the UK because of the heavy traffic that runs through the place.
