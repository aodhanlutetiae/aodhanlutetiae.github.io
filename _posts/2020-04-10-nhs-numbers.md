Asked [today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bThgg_U2h7A#t=41m30s) how many frontline NHS workers have died from from COVID-19, the Head Nurse for the NHS in England, Ruth May, said she had the numbers, 
but wouldn't supply them.

>“We do have numbers of people that have died, whether they’re nurses, midwives, health care assistants, doctors. 
It would be inappropriate for me right now to go into listing them and numbering them because we haven’t got, necessarily, 
all of the position across England with all of the people’s families giving us the permission to talk about them."

A quick count from UK press reports suggest 28 NHS workers have died of Coronavirus, It's impossible to say how close 28 is to the real figure but it looks like the kind of question suited to a Freedom of Information request.

As plenty of people who watched today's press conference observed on social media, it's entirely feasible to release the number of dead as anonymised data.

In Dublin, the Irish government's [daily figures](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/695f10-an-analysis-of-the-6444-cases-of-covid-19-in-ireland-as-of-tuesday-7/) identify how many cases "are associated with healthcare workers". As of midnight last Tuesday
there were 1,765 of the 6444 cases "associated with healthcare workers" or about one in four cases. It's an alarming and exceptional proportion, examined weeks ago by the 
[Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/why-are-25-of-confirmed-covid-19-cases-health-workers-1.4213198).

But unpleasant as the Irish figures are, they do at least get published.
