Asked [today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bThgg_U2h7A#t=41m30s) how many frontline NHS workers have died from from COVID-19, the Head Nurse for the NHS in England, Ruth May, said she had the numbers, 
but wouldn't supply them.

>“We do have numbers of people that have died, whether they’re nurses, midwives, health care assistants, doctors. 
It would be inappropriate for me right now to go into listing them and numbering them because we haven’t got, necessarily, 
all of the position across England with all of the people’s families giving us the permission to talk about them."

A quick count from UK press reports shows at least 22 NHS workers have died of Coronavirus. It's impossible to say how close this is to the real figure but it
looks like the kind of question suited to a Freedom of Information request.

In Dublin, the Irish government's [daily figures](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/695f10-an-analysis-of-the-6444-cases-of-covid-19-in-ireland-as-of-tuesday-7/) published identify how many cases "are associated with healthcare workers". As of midnight last Tuesday
there were 1,765 of the 6444 cases "associated with healthcare workers" or just above one in four cases. This is an alarming figure, examined weeks ago by the 
[Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/why-are-25-of-confirmed-covid-19-cases-health-workers-1.4213198).
