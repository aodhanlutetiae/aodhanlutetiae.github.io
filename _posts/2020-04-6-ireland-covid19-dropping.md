Figures from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention show a drop in cases, and in deaths as of the morning of Sunday April 5. In the past, this has simply been a temporary blip in an otherwise uninterrupted upwards trajectory.

Close to the time of this data Ireland's Health Protection Surveillance Centre observed:

> The median age of confirmed cases is 49 years

> 1,263 cases (26%) are associated with healthcare workers

Deaths are, unsurprisingly, correlated and follow the same drop in reported numbers.
