Figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show a drop in cases, and in deaths, as of the morning of Sunday April 5. In the past, this has simply been a temporary blip in an otherwise uninterrupted upwards trajectory.

Close to the time of this data Ireland's Health Protection Surveillance Centre observed:

> The median age of confirmed cases is 49 years

> 1,263 cases (26%) are associated with healthcare workers

Deaths are, unsurprisingly, correlated and follow the same drop in reported numbers.

### Cavan, Westmeath etc.

Outside of Dublin, the counties with the highest number of cases (relative to their population) are Cavan, Westmeath and Wicklow.

This observation was covered in a piece by the [Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/coronavirus-westmeath-has-highest-rate-of-covid-19-outside-of-dublin-1.4218810) when Westmeath had the highest rate outside Dublin.
