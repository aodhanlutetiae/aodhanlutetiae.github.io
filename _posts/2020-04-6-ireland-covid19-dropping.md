Figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) show a drop in cases as of the morning of Sunday April 5. They dropped from 424 the day before to 321. In the past, short-term drops like this have simply been a temporary blip in an otherwise uninterrupted upwards trajectory.

The evolution really needs to be measured via a seven day average, to avoid the problem of the 'temporary blip'. This I hope will be the next analysis I do of the Irish figures.

Close to the time of this data Ireland's Health Protection Surveillance Centre [observed](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ed3cdd-an-analysis-of-the-4916-cases-of-covid-19-in-ireland-as-of-saturday-/) that one in every four cases is 'associated with' health workers. I *think* this means that one in every four of those who have caught the virus is a healthworker, but this will have to be confirmed. If this is the case, it seems like an exceptionally high number and merits comparison with other EU countries.

Deaths are, unsurprisingly, correlated and follow the same drop in reported numbers, down from 22 reported deaths the day before to 17.

### Cavan, Westmeath etc.

Outside of Dublin, the counties with the highest number of cases (relative to their population) are Cavan, Westmeath and Wicklow.

This observation was covered in a piece by the [Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/coronavirus-westmeath-has-highest-rate-of-covid-19-outside-of-dublin-1.4218810) when Westmeath still had the highest rate outside Dublin.
