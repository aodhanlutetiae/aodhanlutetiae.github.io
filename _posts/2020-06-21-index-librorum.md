The Index Librorum Prohibitorum was for centuries the list of books that the Vatican declared off-limits for Catholics. They are listed on the freedom of expression website [beaconforfreedom.org](http://www.beaconforfreedom.org) along with many other books condemned by censors at various times and places.

4327 works are listed in the database and are now available as a csv at my github link below. There are three main linguistic groups: Latin, French and Italian but there are also books in German, Spanish, English, Dutch and Portuguese. Authors whose work is banned include scientists, philosophers, writers and, of course, theologians.

**Theologians**
- Abelard, Bruno, Calvin, Luther

**Scientists**
- Boyle, Fludd

**Philosophers**
- Bentham, Bergson, Croce, Descartes, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, Locke, Machiavelli, Mill, Montaigne, Montesquieu, Pascal, Proudhon, Renan, Rousseau, Saint-Beuve, Spinoza, Taine, Voltaire

**Writers**
- Balzac, Cousin, D'Alembert, D'Annuzio, Dante, Defoe, Dumas, Flaubert, Foscolo, Goldsmith, Heine, Hugo, Marvell, Milton, Rabelais, Richardson, Sade, Stendhal, Sterne, Zola

The Index was [first published](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07721a.htm) under Paul IV in 1559 and the last edition appeared in 1948. Paul VI [abolished it officially](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum) in 1966.

So what was being banned? Mostly theological works it should be said. There were famous novels however, judged deleterious to a hypothetical Catholic reader's soul: *Madame Bovary* & *Salammbo*, *Pamela*, *La comedie humaine*, *Les mis√©rables* & *Notre Dame de Paris*.

Zola's Complete Works are banned, and *Nana* and *La Terre* get a separate ban as well.

Dante was in trouble for *the Divine Comedy*, Milton for *Paradise Lost* and Dafoe for his *Political history of the devil*.

And politics and political science got people into conflict with Rome too. Zola's celebrated defence of Dreyfuss *J'accuse* is listed, along with Machiavelli's *Il Principe* and Alexandre Dumas writing about divorce.

The writer who comes in for the most citations is Voltaire. He appears 31 times in the Index -- and he found himself in trouble this month too, as someone in Paris [covered him in red paint](https://www.france24.com/en/20200622-protesters-daub-paris-statues-of-voltaire-french-colonial-era-general-in-red-paint) as calls continue for various colonial-era statues to be removed.
