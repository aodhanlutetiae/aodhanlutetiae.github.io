The Index Librorum Prohibitorum was for centuries the list of books that the Vatican declared off-limits for Catholics. They are listed on the freedom of expression website [beaconforfreedom.org](http://www.beaconforfreedom.org) along with many other books condemned by censors at various times and places.

4327 works are listed in the database as banned by the Vatican at one time or another and these are now available as a csv at my github link below. The bulk of the books are in Latin, French or Italian, but there are also books in German, Spanish, English, Dutch and Portuguese. Authors whose work is banned include scientists, philosophers, writers and, of course, theologians.

**Theologians**
- Abelard, Bruno, Calvin, Luther

**Scientists**
- Boyle, Fludd

**Philosophers**
- Bentham, Bergson, Croce, Descartes, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, Locke, Machiavelli, Mill, Montaigne, Montesquieu, Pascal, Proudhon, Renan, Rousseau, Saint-Beuve, Spinoza, Taine, Voltaire

**Writers**
- Balzac, Cousin, D'Alembert, D'Annuzio, Dante, Defoe, Dumas, Flaubert, Foscolo, Goldsmith, Heine, Hugo, Marvell, Milton, Rabelais, Richardson, Sade, Stendhal, Sterne, Zola

So what was being banned? Mostly theological works it should be said. There were famous novels however, judged deleterious to a Catholic's soul: *Madame Bovary* & *Salammbo*, *Pamela*, *La comedie humaine*, *Les misérables* & *Notre Dame de Paris*.

Zola's *Complete Works* are banned, and *Nana* and *La Terre* get a separate ban as well.

Dante was in trouble for *the Divine Comedy*, Milton for *Paradise Lost* and Dafoe for his *Political history of the devil*.

And politics and political science got people into conflict with Rome too. Zola's celebrated defence of Dreyfuss *J'accuse* is listed, along with Machiavelli's *Il Principe* and Alexandre Dumas writing about divorce.

The writer who comes in for the most citations is Voltaire. He appears 31 times in the Index -- for everything from *Candide* to contributing to an edition of Pascal's *Pensées*.

This week he found himself out of favour again as someone in Paris [covered him in red paint](https://www.france24.com/en/20200622-protesters-daub-paris-statues-of-voltaire-french-colonial-era-general-in-red-paint), apparently unhappy that part of the philosopher's fortune came in part from trade in the French colonies.

The Index was [first published](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07721a.htm) under Paul IV in 1559 and the last edition appeared in 1948. Paul VI [abolished it officially](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum) in 1966.
