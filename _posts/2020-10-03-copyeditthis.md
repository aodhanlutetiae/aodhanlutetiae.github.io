This is a collection of all the wonderful *New York Times* subediting quizzes, mostly so I can find them when I need them.

The NYT's standards editor Philip B. Corbett started the quizzes in July 2016 with an introductory quiz that that you can find [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/insider/you-be-the-copy-editor.html). In it he explains that “[New York] Times writers and editors publish 125,000 or more words a day”.

The official 'number 1 quiz' dates from November that year and adopted the interface that allows users to click on the problematic word or passage.
