This is a collection of all the wonderful New York Times subediting quizzes, mostly so I can find them when I need them.

The NYT's standards editor Philip B. Corbett started the quizzes in July 2016 with an introductory quiz that didn't have the interface that became standard and that you can find [here] (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/insider/you-be-the-copy-editor.html).

In it he explains that *“[New York] Times writers and editors publish 125,000 or more words a day”*.
