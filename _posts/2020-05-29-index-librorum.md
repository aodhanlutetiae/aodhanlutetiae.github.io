The Index Librorum Prohibitorum was for centuries the list of books that the Vatican declared off-limits for Catholics. They are listed on the freedom of expression website [beaconforfreedom.org](http://www.beaconforfreedom.org) along with many other books condemned by censors at various times and places.
