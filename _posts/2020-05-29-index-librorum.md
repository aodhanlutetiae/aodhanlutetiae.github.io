The Index Librorum Prohibitorum was for centuries the list of books that the Vatican declared off-limits for Catholics. They are listed on the freedom of expression website [beaconforfreedom.org](http://www.beaconforfreedom.org) along with many other books condemned by censors at various times and places.

(The Index outlawing the reading of Montaigne's famous *Essays* from a 1770 edition of the Index made available online through the Gallica service of the French national library)

4327 works are listed in the database. There are three main linguistic groups: Latin, French and Italian but there are also books in German, Spanish, English, Dutch and Portuguese. Authors whose work is banned include scientists, philosophers, and writers.

**Theologians**
- Abelard, Bruno, Calvin, Luther

**Scientists**
- Boyle, Fludd

**Philosophers**
- Bentham, Bergson, Croce, Descartes, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, Locke, Machiavelli, Mill, Montaigne, Montesquieu, Pascal, Proudhon, Renan, Rousseau, Saint-Beuve, Spinoza, Taine, Voltaire

**Writers**
- Balzac, Cousin, D'Alembert, D'Annuzio, Dante, Defoe, Dumas, Flaubert, Foscolo, Goldsmith, Heine, Hugo, Marvell, Milton, Rabelais, Richardson, Sade, Stendhal, Sterne, Zola

The Index was first published under Paul IV in 1559 and the last edition appeared in 1948. Paul VI abolished it officially in 1966.

So what was being banned? Mostly theological works it should be said. There were famous novels however, judged deleterious to a hypothetical Catholic reader's soul: *Madame Bovary* & *Salammbo*, *Pamela*, *La comedie humaine*, *Les mis√©rables* & *Notre Dame de Paris*.

Zola's Complete Works are banned, and *Nana* and *La Terre* get a separate ban as well.

Dante was in trouble for *the Divine Comedy*, Milton for *Paradise Lost* and Dafoe for his *Political history of the devil*.

And politics and political science got people into conflict with Rome too. Zola's celebrated defence of Dreyfuss *J'accuse* is listed, along with Machiavelli's *Il Principe* and Alexandre Dumas writing about divorce.
