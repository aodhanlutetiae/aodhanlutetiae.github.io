The Guardian has closed out 2020 with a series of pieces on what's wrong with the Lords. 'Lords reform' now exists on the site [as a dedicated category](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/lordreform). Its [editorial](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/the-guardian-view-on-crony-peerages-a-deeply-rotten-tradition) just before Christmas was in response to the Prime Minister's latest appointment to the upper house, Peter Cruddas:

> "In 2006, Tony Blair was embroiled in a cash-for-honours affair that resulted in a criminal investigation but no charges. One newspaper columnist wrote that the case illustrated “the decay of government and the putrefaction of the honours system”. That journalist was Boris Johnson, who earlier this week used his privilege as prime minister to ennoble Peter Cruddas, a businessman, philanthropist and Conservative party donor. Mr Cruddas’s name had been rejected by the Lords appointments commission. Mr Johnson deemed their judgment unfair and overruled it. That is not a healthy precedent, irrespective of any specific case."

Also on the site the same day the Lord Speaker, Norman Fowler, [called for an inquiry](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/house-of-lords-peerages-appointments) into "the peerages system" (the Lord Speaker chairs business in the House. The post was created in 2006). For Fowler, the problems are essentially: too many lords already, no upper limit to how many can be appointed, no way to vet appointments (since the House of Lords Appointments Commission can only advise) and Lords being appointed by the government when parliament is not sitting.

This followed [the report](https://www.ft.com/content/5a456127-6f9a-4f87-aacc-5a54d8da8da7) a few months' earlier in the Financial Times that

> "The elevation of the billionaire businessman and Tory party benefactor Michael Spencer to the House of Lords on Friday means that at least 22 former donors to political parties have been given peerages in the past 13 years, according to calculations by the Financial Times."



**Background**

The [Burns report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmpubadm/662/662.pdf) in 2017 called for a limit of 600 Lords with appointments to be made by the House of Commons rather than the government so as to be shared between parties.

In 2014, changes were made that made it easier for Lords to retire. In 1999, most of the hereditary peers were removed (92 remained).
