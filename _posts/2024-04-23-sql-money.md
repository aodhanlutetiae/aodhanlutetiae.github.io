You can look up your MP or even just your postcode on [the website](https://news.sky.com/story/westminster-accounts-search-for-your-mp-or-enter-your-full-postcode-12771627, and the methodology explains [how it works](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2023/01/08/the-westminster-accounts-methodology/. It points out that the data is restricted to the current Parliament.

*It only includes donations, payments, members, all-party parliamentary groups and parties that were made or have operated from 19 December 2019 onwards.* 

Crucially, it says that the three sources behind the database

*will be updated on an ongoing basis. Every time a new register or version of is published, the data will be collected, cleaned, tested and then added to the database.*

Simon Willison pulled out a [SQLite database](https://lite.datasette.io/?sql=https://gist.github.com/simonw/ee4d5938016b10c490f7efa03c4bf185) last year which we can query in detail. There is a datasette instance online but below I’ve used the [standalone database](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2023/sky-westminster-files.db) he produced, by querying it with the online query tool [SQLIME](https://sqlime.org/. 

It looks like his database is over a year old, but he’s supplied the code and tools, [in his walkthrough](https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/scraping-flourish, to make a fresh scrape of the Sky-Tortoise database. Below we use his old database — until I figure out how to run his code.

What’s in the database? Seven tables are explained on the datasette.
