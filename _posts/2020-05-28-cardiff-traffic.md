Is TomTom data any good? I've no idea. How much of the traffic on the road outside my house does it actually track? Now is a good time to find out since it's offering [its data](https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/) for analysis to see how congestion has dropped in various cities during the Lockdown.
