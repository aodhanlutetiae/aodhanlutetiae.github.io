The [We Count project](https://telraam.net/en/what-is-telraam) distributes simple photo sensors for people to put on their street-facing windows so a computer can count how many vehicles, bikes and pedestrians pass by every day. Cities across Europe have people monitoring their streets. I got my sensor running at the end of November.
