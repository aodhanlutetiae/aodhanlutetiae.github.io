UK food inspectors have abandoned plans to use an algorithm in part of their food hygiene rating system after a £100,000 trial. Fifteen local authorities took part in the six-week pilot in 2022. But in the end many local authorities found their own solutions to a post-Covid food inspection backlog, and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the automation raised too many ethical questions.

The technology predicted two things: the hygiene rating of a food outlet that was waiting for inspection, and the probability that it would be “compliant” (a 3, 4 or 5 rating) or “non-compliant” (a 0, 1 or 2 rating). The model was to be used just to identify the most urgent cases, leaving local authority inspectors to establish the actual rating after a visit.
