Cardiff breathes clean air during lockdown

Three weeks into the UK’s shutdown, levels of Nitrogen Dioxide in Cardiff have almost halved compared to a year ago.

The city’s two stations for measuring air quality – on the central pedestrianised [Queen St](https://www.google.com/maps/place/51%C2%B028'54.4%22N+3%C2%B010'34.5%22W/@51.48178,-3.17625,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d51.48178!4d-3.17625), and on the busy [Newport Road](https://www.google.com/maps/place/51%C2%B029'27.5%22N+3%C2%B009'08.3%22W/@51.49096,-3.152305,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d51.49096!4d-3.152305) – both show that levels of NO2 last week were close to half what they were for the same week last year.

The [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/10/air-pollution-drops-drastically-across-uk-annual-global-carbon/) reported a few days ago that there had been a similar drop in Hafodyrynys, outside Caerphilly.

The village is [infamous](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-48694087) for one of the worst levels of NO2 in the UK.

Cardiff Council said this year it was considering a congestion charge, for a capital city that has a population of only about 350,000 people. The Welsh government has just closed
a period of public consultations after it put forward its [Clean Air Plan for Wales](https://gov.wales/clean-air-plan-wales) late last year.

Air pollution is blamed for 2,000 deaths a year in Wales.
