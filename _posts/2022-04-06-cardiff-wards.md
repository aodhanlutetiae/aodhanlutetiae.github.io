Local elections are coming so we need maps.

The Cardiff 2017 turnout is [here](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/ryky0/) but has an island (attached to Butetown ward) that doesn't really need to be there and some of the wards have been adjusted

The new 2021-22 layout is [here](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/2QEo5/), without the island

The Ceredigion ward layout has also been revised, from 40 to 34, and there's a template [here](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/5sLlR/)
