This story by datahut did two things with Amazon data in mid-March: first, it scraped the data from the Amazon website using Scrapy. Then it carried out an analysis of that data to find the pricing that it deems 'predatory'. You can skip the scraping stage and just collect the [two csv files](https://data.world/data-hut/predatory-pricing-data-from-amazon) that result from the scraping and jump straight to the analysis.
