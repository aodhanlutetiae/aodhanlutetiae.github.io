I have finally put some OSINT practice questions we've used in class on a [heroku app](https://osintquiz.herokuapp.com/). Warning: the page takes a moment to load since the app has to wake up.


**Other quizzes**

There are two great CTF quizzes produced by [@cybersoc](https://cybersoc.wales/) at Cardiff University: [Cyber detective](https://ctf.cybersoc.wales/) and [Cyber investigator](https://investigator.cybersoc.wales/).

There are also the ongoing [@quiztime geolocation puzzles](https://twitter.com/quiztime) on Twitter and several quizzes from [@Sector035](https://twitter.com/Sector035) that run over email: [2019](https://twitter.com/sector035/status/1211038518635614208?lang=en) and [2020](https://twitter.com/Sector035/status/1344378578490830848) (and the fiendishly difficult [2017 quiz](https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/943867444543844352)).

There's also a starter quiz for geolocation by [First Draft](https://firstdraftnews.org/en/education/curriculum-resource/test-your-verification-skills-with-our-geolocation-challenge/).
