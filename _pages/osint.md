Here are some quizzes for working on your OSINT skills.

There are two great CTF quizzes produced by [@cybersoc](https://cybersoc.wales/) at Cardiff University: [Cyber detective](https://ctf.cybersoc.wales/) and [Cyber investigator](https://investigator.cybersoc.wales/).

There are also the ongoing [@quiztime geolocation puzzles](https://twitter.com/quiztime) on Twitter, [some challenges from @OSINTDOJO](https://twitter.com/OSINTDojo) and several quizzes from [@Sector035](https://twitter.com/Sector035) that run over email: [2019](https://twitter.com/sector035/status/1211038518635614208?lang=en) and [2020](https://twitter.com/Sector035/status/1344378578490830848) (and the fiendishly difficult [2017 quiz](https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/943867444543844352)).

There's also this series of challenges at [sourcing.games](https://sourcing.games).
