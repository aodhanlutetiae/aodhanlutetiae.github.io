======

This page has some OSINT CTF tasks I have used in class.

**Other quizzes**
There are two great CTF quizzes produced by [@cybersoc](https://cybersoc.wales/) at Cardiff University: [here](https://ctf.cybersoc.wales/) and [here](https://investigator.cybersoc.wales/). There are also the ongoing [@quiztime puzzles](https://twitter.com/quiztime) on Twitter and several quizzes from [@Sector035](https://twitter.com/Sector035) that run over email: [2019](https://twitter.com/sector035/status/1211038518635614208?lang=en) and [2020](https://twitter.com/Sector035/status/1344378578490830848) (and the fiendishly difficult [2017 quiz](https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/943867444543844352)).

**This quiz -- work in progress. Ready in March 2021**
