I teach data journalism in Cardiff University's School of Journalism, Jomec. This means co-running our MSc in Computational Journalism and teaching one-semester courses to undergrad and postgrad journalism students. I used to work in broadcast mainly but have a byline in most formats at this stage. I'm originally from Ireland and came to Cardiff via Paris and London.

What does that involve?
