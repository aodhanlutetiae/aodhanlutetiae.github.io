I teach data journalism at Cardiff University's School of Journalism, JOMEC. This means co-running our [MSc in Computational Journalism](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc) and teaching one-semester courses to undergrad and postgrad journalism students and occasionally to working journalists. I used to work in broadcast mainly but I have a byline in most formats at this point. I'm originally from Ireland and came to Cardiff via Paris and London and quite a few trips to Africa.
